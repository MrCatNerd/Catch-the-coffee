# Catch-the-coffee
A game

A pygame and tkinter game:
the main manu is made with tkinter because its very easy to create button with tkinter,
and i made the real game with pygame.

to install pygame you need to install pip(by installing python first)
and then go to the cmd / terminal / powershell / a .bat file / whatever
and type: 
pip install pygame
or
pip3 install pygame

make sure to run the correct file of the game to start the game without baggs because the game got
a 3 file with some global vars for the game.

the game isn't coded complitly yet so the code isn't in this github file yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
