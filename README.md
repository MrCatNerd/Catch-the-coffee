A game made with pygame and tkinter:
(the game is made with pygame,
but the main manu is made with tkinter because its easyer to make button with
tkinter)

to install pygame you need to install pip(by installing python first)
and then go to the cmd / terminal / powershell / a .bat file / whatever
and type: 
pip install pygame
or
pip3 install pygame

WARNING : make sure to run the correct file of the game to start the game without baggs because the game got
a 3 file with some global vars for the game.
